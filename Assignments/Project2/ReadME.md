# Overview
Objective is to download and create tables to hold lots of data that is available from the links below for future projects

## Data Files
Specifically we want the following data files. Most are shape files, one is a csv.

Primary US Roads
- https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2019/PRIMARYROADS/tl_2019_us_primaryroads.zip\
US Rail Roads\
- http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2019/RAILS/tl_2019_us_rails.zip\
States\
- https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2021/STATE/tl_2021_us_state.zip\
Military Bases\
- https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2021/MIL/tl_2021_us_mil.zip\
Airports\
- https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/data/Airport_and_Plane_Data/airports.csv\
Time Zones\
- https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_time_zones.zip

## Deliverables:
- Create a folder in your github Assignments folder called P02A
- Export the sql to create your tables and indexes into 1 file per table.
- Select the first 5-10 rows and output those in a manner that's readable, again, 1 per table.
